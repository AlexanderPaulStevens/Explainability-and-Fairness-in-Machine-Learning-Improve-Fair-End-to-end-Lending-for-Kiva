# Explainability-and-Fairness-in-Machine-Learning:Improve-Fair-End-to-end-Lending-for-Kiva
This project investigated the explainability and fairness of microfinancing, more specifically on lending data from the Kiva Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding). 
Several bias mitigation techniques were compared based on their explainability, fairness and performance.
